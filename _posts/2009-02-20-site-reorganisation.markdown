I've been doing some reorganisation of the [neise.co.uk](http://www.neise.co.uk) domain space.

The original site [(www.neise.co.uk](http://www.neise.co.uk)) is now a shared site for the whole family; and will be being worked on shortly. There are now three new subdomains: [ben.neise.co.uk](http://ben.neise.co.uk) ÔÇô which you're looking at; [lorna.neise.co.uk](http://lorna.neise.co.uk) and [roslin.neise.co.uk](http://roslin.neise.co.uk).

This blog will be used for noting interesting things that I come across during my work; mostly useful VMware PowerCLI scripts that I find or write, and links to interesting articles.

This is the first time I've used WordPress, so bear with me as I try to get the CSS to display code nicely.
