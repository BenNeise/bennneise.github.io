VMware have launched a [new community site for code examples](http://communities.vmware.com/community/developer/codecentral), and there's a section on [VMware vSphere PowerCLI](http://communities.vmware.com/community/developer/codecentral/vsphere_powercli) (formerly VI Toolkit).

They seem to be picking the best scripts from the regular contributors to the forums, so it's a good place to have a look for examples. They're rated by users, and tend to be slightly better documented than the ones posted in the forums (which tend to be appended and amended as the thread progresses).
