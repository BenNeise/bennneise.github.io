While speaking to a gentleman from VMware last year, I gently chided Citrix for their [grand-renaming](http://www.thincomputing.net/blog/citrix-presentation-server-renamed-to-xenapp-server.html), and made comment that at least VMware didn't succumb to this modern plague of replacing perfectly good names with ones formed from pure marketing-fluff. It was shortly after this that VMware announced the change from Virtual Infrastructure to vSphere.

Alongside this well publicised change; VMware Toolkit (for Windows) is now called [vSphere PowerCLI](VMware Toolkit (for Windows) is now called vSphere PowerCLI.).

I sometimes wonder if all this random capitalisation is part of some great scheme to prevent the world's pinky fingers from atrophy by having them constantly reach for the Shift key.

There's also a [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/PowerCLI), if you're into that sort of thing.
