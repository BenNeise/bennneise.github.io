I love this script from Alan Renouf:-

> [F]ind the offending snapshot, find the person who created it, get their email address from AD and send them an email reminding them of their mortal sin.

Our IndependentNonPersistent drives here prevent us from using snapshots, but IÔÇÖm working on a ÔÇ£utilisation checkingÔÇØ script, that should help us cull some neglected machines and I might integrate some of AlÔÇÖs AD interrogation into that.
