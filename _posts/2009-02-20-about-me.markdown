My name is Ben Neise, and I work for Sky in Livingston. I specialise in automation, deployment and [XaaS](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_as_a_service).

IÔÇÖve previously worked as a Desktop Virtualisation Specialist at Ignis Asset Management, as an Infrastructure Support Consultant for DellÔÇÖs Global Application Packaging Centre, and as an application packager.

IÔÇÖve got a degree in Psychology which is more useful than it sounds: writing lab reports is an excellent schooling for technical writing; doing any kind of testing involves the setting up of control groups and ensuring that variables are controlled; and my unit in statistical methodology has come in useful so many times that I think it should be compulsory on all BSc degree courses.

In my spare time, I like playing computer games, watching films and taking [photos](http://500px.com/GuruAnt).
