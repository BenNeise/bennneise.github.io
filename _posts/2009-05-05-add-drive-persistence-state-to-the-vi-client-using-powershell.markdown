IÔÇÖve further adapted [HugoÔÇÖs script](http://www.peetersonline.nl/index.php/vmware/add-snapshot-information-to-the-vi-client-using-powershell/) to add a custom attribute which shows the drive persistence state(s) when the script was run.

The script also adds drive state information for templates as well as VM objects.
