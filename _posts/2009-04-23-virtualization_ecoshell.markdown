IÔÇÖve started looking at the recently released beta of [VizioncoreÔÇÖs Virtualization EcoShell](http://thevesi.org/index.jspa), which is a VMware tailored version of [PowerGUI](http://www.powergui.org/index.jspa).

Both are GUI front-ends for (among other things) [VMwareÔÇÖs Powershell based VI Toolkit](http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/PowerCLI/), [which IÔÇÖve talked about before](http://ben.neise.co.uk/index.php/2009/03/using-vmwares-vi-toolkit/).

I never got the full benefit from PowerGui, as by the time IÔÇÖd realised there was more to it than the (very good) script editor, IÔÇÖd already developed a lot of the scripts I needed ÔÇô scripts which PowerGui would have been able to generate for me a lot more quickly (cÔÇÖest la vie).

EcoShell has the ability to export some [nice looking reports](http://www.virtu-al.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/virtualcenterreport.jpg) (although the [Visio based vDiagram](http://ict-freak.nl/2009/01/27/vmware-vdiagram-script-by-alan-renout/) functionality still doesnÔÇÖt work for me).

ThereÔÇÖs more information on EcoShell over at [Virtua-Al](http://www.virtu-al.net/2009/04/15/the-turtle-has-landed-the-ves-is-here/).
