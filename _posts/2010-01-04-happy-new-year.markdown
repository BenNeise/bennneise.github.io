Happy New Year to everyone!

I passed the VCP on vSphere 4 just before Christmas with 463/500. At the time the deadline for taking the exam without having to the attend the [What's New](http://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/courses.cfm?ui=www&a=one&id_subject=10069) was 31st December 2009, but that's [now been extended to the 31st January](http://mylearn.vmware.com/portals/certification/). It was nice to have it out of the way before Christmas though.

The exam seemed no more difficult than the VCP on VI 3; I think they even reused a few of the questions. I found the following useful:-

- [Simon Long's VCP vSphere 4 Practice Exams](http://www.simonlong.co.uk/blog/vcp-vsphere-4-practice-exam/)
- [vSphere 4 Configuration Maximums](http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vsphere4/r40/vsp_40_config_max.pdf)
- [Barry Coombs' VMware vSphere cue-cards](http://virtualisedreality.wordpress.com/vcp-in-vsphere-4-0-study-notes/)

Those sites also contain numerous links to other resources, so I'm sure you'll find something which will suit your revision style.

Next on my to-do list is the [Microsoft 70-431 Microsoft SQL Server 2005  - Implementation and Maintenance](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-431&locale=en-us).
