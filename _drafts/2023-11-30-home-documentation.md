While browsing last week, I came across a [HackerNews post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38444577) about [Home Documentation](https://luke.hsiao.dev/blog/housing-documentation/). I've long been a fan of this, and I was currently revisiting both the content, and the platform on which I document, so I thought I'd add my 2Â¢.

# Requirements

I'm going to focus more on content, than the specific platform, but my requirements are fairly typical.

- The solution needs to be available (and up to date/synchronised) on Windows, macOS laptops, iOS phones and Android
- Needs to be accessible and easily updated by the whole family. Needs to be WYSIWYG, no markdown, and _certainly_ no checking things into Git!
- I'd prefer to avoid self-hosting, as it's likely that the run book itself would need to contain instructions for fixing whatever self-hosted solution I ended up using. Using a trusted cloud provider also means I can use things like MFA. 
- Ideally, it shouldn't cost me anything extra

I love [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), but paying for the the whole family for something they'd barely use irks me. [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/?public=1) is _okay_, but the free-form format tends towards mess. So I settled on Microsoft Loop, which I get via my Microsoft 365 Subscription.


# What does it contain?

## Financial stuff

Also, it's not nice to think about, but [bad things happen](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2015/05/are-you-secretly-hurting-your-spouse-by-looking-after-the-family-finances/), and this forms a bit of a living will.

- Insurance details for the home and our cars. The next time you are insuring your home or car, also make sure to note down all of the details they require: driver's license numbers, average mileage, the [job title and industry you tweaked to get the best rate](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/insurance/car-insurance-job-picker/). Even though most comparison sites will store the details, you should also be checking rates for those companies which are not on the comparison sites.  
- Our address history. The dates we moved in and out of each house. 
- Utilities. Who provides our gas, electric, internet and TV? What plans are we on. What's the contract end date and is there an early termination charge
- Subscriptions. Who are we paying for what. Yes... you know about Microsoft Game Pass, but did you know about _second_ Microsoft Game Pass (because Microsoft don't really account for [gaming families](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/14/23795351/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-friends-and-family-plan-preview-end)). 


## Home maintenance

More practical information

- Home insurance details (also in the financial section, which is where [Loop Components](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-microsoft-loop-9f4d8d4f-dfc6-4518-9ef6-069408c21f0c) come in handy)
- Replacement items. Which particular (Ikea) glasses and plates do we use? What was size of bin bags works best in the kitchen bin?
- Bulb types. We have an old house, and use a suprisingly wide range of bulb types. 
- Which paint colors did we use for each room?


## Vehicle Details

- Insurance details
- When did we buy the cars
- MOT & Service dates dates

## Home Technology

Like a lot of people that work in IT. I like playing around with various solutions. And while the family certainly appreciate the benefits of having, say, a PiHole; it's not always appreciated as much when it breaks. And I'm out of the house. I'm sure a lot of us have had those phoencalls, wehere we try to describe from memory exactly which cable needs pulled. 

- [What to do when the internet breaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2F1rFmyQmY)
- Which particular application do you need to use to program that one color changing wifi bulb we use in the fireplace, which is inexplicably a different brand to all the others. 
- What model of printer do we have, and what ink does it use? What's the name of the mobile application that lets me print from my phone, and how do I set it up? 
- Links to various web interfaces for internal services. The router admin page. The printer admin page.
- Links to various external web interfaces. Hive. Ring. 

## Misc

- Our Christmas card list and addresses
- Travel documents

# What doesn't it contain?

- Usernames and passwords. 
- Scanned documents. I've not yet found a good way to embed. There's probably something I can do with linking to 

# Potential Improvements

I love the idea of adding videos & photos.

Task boards for home improvements

Network diagrams. One of the things that Notion supports, which Loop does not yet are Mermaid diagrams.
