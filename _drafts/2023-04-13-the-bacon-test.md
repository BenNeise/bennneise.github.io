Because, historically the software we use in our team (vRealize Automation and vRealize Orchestrator) weren't widely used in Central Scotland, we didn't have a large pool of experienced talent from which to draw. We therefore tended to hire general IT people with an aptitude for solving technical problems.

This gave us a problem when it came to designing some sort of technical test which would allow us to judge someone's potential competence on a piece of software which they were unlikely to have had any prior experience.

To do this, we came up with The Bacon Test.

- It's quick enough that people are more inclined to do it.
- It's obviously not real work. Some people may even describe it as fun.

The lack of instructions gives people a lot of scope for answering the question. Someone at the start of their career, may provide a simple bash script. Someone with slightly more experience, a more comprehensive Python script. Someone more senior might provide an elegant, modular solution alongside some design documentation. 

Over the years we have been using it; we've found that it has proven to be a fairly accurate barometer of - not just someone's technical ability - but their apprach to solving a problem.
